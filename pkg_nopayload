1. Create folder with name "scripts"
2. Copy all necessary files (if needed) into "scripts" folder
3. Go to "scripts" folder via Terminal and run next command:
----
pico postinstall
----
4. Type or copy into editor your procedures, it will be your executable shell script, for example:
----
#!/bin/bash
ntp="time.euro.apple.com"
#
sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -setusingnetworktime on
sudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver "$ntp"
#
exit 0
(the "exit 0" section is necessary in my case, and I think, it's a good practice to end script with positive exit-code)
----
5. Press Ctrl+X to exit from editor, when it prompts you about saving, press Y.
6. Add execution permission to "postinstall" file via:
----
sudo chmod a+x postinstall
----
7. Create PKG via next command (use full paths):
sudo pkgbuild --identifier com.package.name --nopayload --scripts /Users/your_user_name/your_folder/scripts/ "/Users/your_user_name/your_folder/your_package.pkg"
