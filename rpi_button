# Yepp, it's just RPi that doing some stuff on button press (in my case it's played HOMM3 new week sound)

Download and write to SD-card latest raspbian lite image from official site:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

Boot up and configure your RPi with raspi-config utility (ssh, for example)

Install system and software updates with:
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Install cli-media-player:
$ sudo apt install mpg123

Make a project directory for all your files and scripts (mkdir -p %project_folder_name%, I don't think there's is a problem with that case)
Copy your soundfile to RPi via scp utility or with your favorite way:
$ scp %path/to/file% username@rpi_hostname:%fullpath/to/project_folder_name% # may require 'sudo'

Install GPIO python modules:
$ sudo apt install python-gpiozero python3-gpiozero
#apt install python-rpi.gpio python3-rpi.gpio
#(I didn't use this modules in my scripts)

Check your RPi GPIO connectors via 'pinout' command. There's some pseudo-graphics output.
We need just 1 GND and 1 GPIO.
(on my RPi 1 model B: 6pin = GND, 7pin = GPIO)

I prefer to connect any periferials when RPi power is off.
(for safety reasons, or I'm some kind of paranoid)
So shutdown rpi with:
$ sudo poweroff now
(you can skip 'sudo' when you run 'poweroff' directly on device, but via ssh-connection it's required)

Connect your button to GND and GPIO connectors and boot RPi up again.

Now we can create python-script like this one:
(dash-lines are just the way to show the edges of our script)
-----
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os
from gpiozero import Button

soundFile = "/path/to/soundfile.mp3"
button = Button(4)

while True:
    if button.is_pressed:
        os.system("mpg123 " + soundFile)
    else:
        pass
-----

We can set up our script to background running on each system startup.
Create shell-script like this one:
-----
#!/bin/sh
nohup /path/to/python-script.py >/dev/null 2>&1 &
-----

And add a rule into the our user's crontab (don't use 'sudo' here):
$ crontab -e
(choose your favorite editor)
add string like:
@reboot /path/to/shell-script.sh

After next reboot we can just push the button to play our media-file.
